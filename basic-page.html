    <h2>What is tree</h2>
    <p>Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

        Binary Tree is a special datastructure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition
        that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a
        linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in
        linked list.</p>

        <h2>Important Terms</h2>
        <span>Following are the important terms related to tree</span>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Path--</b></li>
            <p>Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges pf a tree</p>
            <li><b>Root--</b></li>
            <p>The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.</p>
            <li><b>Parent--</b></li>
            <p>Any node except the root node has a edge upward to a node is called parent</p>
            <li><b>Child--</b></li>
            <p>The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node</p>
            <li><b>Leaf--</b></li>
            <p>The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.</p>
            <li><b>Subtree--</b></li>
            <p>Subtree represents the descendants of a node</p>
            <hr>
            <h2><b>Tree Node--</b></h2>
            <p>The code to write a tree node would be similar to what is given below. It has a data part and references to its left and right child nodes.</p>
            <pre>
            <em>struct</em> node {
                int data;
                <em>struct</em> node *leftChild;
               <em> struct</em> node *rightChild;
            };


            </pre>
            <span>In a tree, all nodes share common construct</span>
            <hr>
            <h2>BST Basic operations</h2>
            <p>The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure, are the following-</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Insert-</li>
                <p>
                    Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree
                </p>
                <li>Search-</li>
                <p>Searches an element in a tree.</p>
                <li>Preorder Traversal-</li>
                <p>Traverses a tree in a pre-order tree</p>
                <li>Inorder Traversal-</li>
                <p>Traverses atree in an in-order manner.</p>
                <li>Postorder Traversal-</li>
                <p>Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.</p>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <hr>
    <h2>Algorithm</h2>
    <pre>
        if root is <strong> NULL</strong>
        then vreate root Node
        return

        if root exists then
        compare the the data with node data
        while until insertion position is located
        If data is greater than node data
        goto right subtree
        else

        goto left subtree
        endwhile
        insert data
        end if
    </pre>
